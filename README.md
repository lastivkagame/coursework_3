About some questions:

1.I tried to comment on my code, I hopefully so a a little clearer for you

2.I apologize for my English, I’m working on it)))

3.Exist one interesting moment in my code.When I try add browser Visual Studio was very dumb(I don’t know why it) because of it so I solve it in other way. At first, I took this part with the browser to another solution and it solution begin work quickly. Next I create good exe file by browse and next I simple start it in another process. (Sorry for it but now I don’t have more time to fix this
(Also I will just add a code file about part of the browser)

4.-> if you download it and want start successfully delete folder 'browser' and unzip the acrhive 'browser'
